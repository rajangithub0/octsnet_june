            Soccer, also known as football in most countries outside the United
            States and Canada, is a globally popular sport played by two teams
            of eleven players with a spherical ball. The game is played on a
            rectangular field with a goal at each end. The objective of the game
            is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.
